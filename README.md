### Abstract
The miniature ftp system consists of two binaries, mftpserve and mftp, the server and client respectively.  Both programs were written in C to execute in the schoolâ€™s Linux OS environment (CentOS 6).  The programs will utilize the Unix TCP/IP sockets interface (library) to communicate with each other across a TCP/IP network. Only IPv4 addressing will be supported by these programs.
